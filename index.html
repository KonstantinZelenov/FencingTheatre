      <h2>Past</h2>
      <p class="second">Let's imagine a bright and colorful world of artistic fencing and stage combat, where artistic fighters, like real heroes, fight each other on stage and on movie screens in front of thousands of spectators.</p>
      <p class="second">In 2019, the school of artistic fencing and stage combat <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fencingtheatre/" target="blank">"Fencing Theatre"</a> was created, which has become a real mecca for young and talented athletes. This enviable project is headed by none other than <a href="https://vk.com/viganorth" target="blank">Konstantin Zelenov</a>, a two-time world champion in artistic fencing and a multiple Russian champion in this sport. He has a higher coaching and pedagogical education, more than 10 years of experience in the field of artistic fencing, and he is ready to share all his rich experience with his students.</p>
      <p class="second">Pupils of the school have repeatedly become winners and prize-winners of all-Russian and international competitions in artistic fencing. This indicates that the school has not only a high level of professionalism, but also the most advanced teaching methods, as well as experienced coaches who can help each student achieve success in their careers.</p>
      <p class="second">For Fencing Theater there are no limits when it comes to the creative ideas and projects of their students. The school is open to everyone who wants to learn artistic fencing and stage combat, regardless of age, gender and level of training. Start your career in the world of artistic fencing and stage combat today with our school and Konstantin Zelenov!</p>

      <h2>Present</h2>
      <p class="second">Now our school is a place where creativity and sport meet and create a unique atmospheric mix. Every day, trainers and students come together to immerse themselves in the world of martial arts and enjoy the process of training. The rhythmic sounds of swords, cries that call to battle, and halls filled with bright light - all this creates an incredible atmosphere that inspires creativity and creation. In addition to training, the school is actively involved in the creation of films and videos, providing its experts in the field of stage combat and combat choreography. Performances in theaters and at various events have become an integral part of the school's activities. And, of course, shooting fight movies is a real quintessence of the art of stage combat. But the most important thing is a joint rest and pleasant communication. The students of our school are a close team of like-minded people who love their work and enjoy life in all its manifestations.</p>

      <h2>Future</h2>
      <p class="second">Our school has great potential to develop and improve teamwork and create more important and exciting events. In the future, we would like to create productions that can compete and win international competitions. We also envision a more effective and attractive recruitment program that not only teaches them swordsmanship and stage combat, but also gives them the opportunity to travel to other countries such as acting and dancing. As we can see, we set ourselves a difficult goal, but we are confident that our school can achieve it with the help of talented people and experienced leadership!</p>
