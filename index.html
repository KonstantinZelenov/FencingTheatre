      <h2>Present</h2>
      <p class="second">Now our school is a place where creativity and sport meet and create a unique atmospheric mix. Every day, trainers and students come together to immerse themselves in the world of martial arts and enjoy the process of training. The rhythmic sounds of swords, cries that call to battle, and halls filled with bright light - all this creates an incredible atmosphere that inspires creativity and creation. In addition to training, the school is actively involved in the creation of films and videos, providing its experts in the field of stage combat and combat choreography. Performances in theaters and at various events have become an integral part of the school's activities. And, of course, shooting fight movies is a real quintessence of the art of stage combat. But the most important thing is a joint rest and pleasant communication. The students of our school are a close team of like-minded people who love their work and enjoy life in all its manifestations.</p>
